# Hunt_The_Wumpus
Hunt the Wumpus is a strategy / maze game where the objective is for the player to kill the Wumpus without becoming the Wumpus' prey or 
succumbing to environmental hazards. Players manuever around a grid representing a cave. Besides being killed by the Wumpus, players can 
also die by falling into pits or being killed by bats. Players kill the Wumpus by firing an arrow into a grid position they haven't 
entered where they believe the Wumpus is hiding. If they target the wrong place, the Wumpus awakes and kills the player.
